# CORNE MAP
This is my custom firmware build for corne v3.

## Usage
If you would like to use my build, just clone this to your keymap space, or create a new keymap, and then flash it.
*subject to **significant** change*

## Reference:
- Leave out lots of RBG effects to save size {Enable this in [config.h] to revert.}
- Disabled mouse keys.

## Dev notes: 
- Implement ocean dream.
- Figure out where I can reduce firmware size.
- Read OLED docs.

## Return implementation plans
- Fix my game layer to activate with double tap instead of current setup 
- Give game layer a double shot layer for access to F[x] keys 
- Maybe switch my arrow keys to match vim layout -_-
